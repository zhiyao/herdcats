# Website app screenshots

## Latest website images

The Features page and Support's Compose and Voice examples use
`assets/screenshots/` from the 28 October 2026 refresh (source revision
`5caa3009bbb578113973715ed61c50f9bee62c6e`). Both gallery appearances are copied
by `npm run prebuild`; content hashes in `versions.json` version the image URLs
so refreshed captures bypass older browser caches. The homepage retains the original cat scene without a screenshot showcase.

The Timeline, Bridge setup, and approval examples in Support retain the
27 October captures documented below; the latest supplied gallery set does
not include these examples.

## Supplemental Support captures

Captured on 27 October 2026 from Herdcats **0.5.0 (108)**, built from commit
`fdd9433844ae` (see the asset manifest for the full revision), in the
`website-compose-bridge` Herdr worktree.

These are unaltered app UI captures using the app's built-in simulator
fixtures, not mockups or private conversations. Fixtures demonstrate the
current views; they do not certify a live SSH connection or a published
Bridge release. At capture time, the pinned installer supplied Bridge 0.3.0 for Claude
and Codex. The current app pins Bridge 0.5.0 with Claude, Codex, Agy, Pi, and
Cursor support; Pi requires its separately enabled extension.

Device: iPhone 17 Pro simulator, iOS 27.0. Original PNGs are 1206 × 2622.
Website copies are 600 × 1304 WebP images, resized with Lanczos and encoded
at quality 90. Their contents are unchanged. A 9:41 status-bar override is
cleared after capture. The light and dark conversation views use a seeded
Compose draft with automatic keyboard focus disabled for framing.

| Asset | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `timeline-light` | Light Timeline, tool activity, and a Compose draft |
| `timeline-dark` | The same conversation in dark mode |
| `terminal-compose` | The original terminal output with a reviewed draft |
| `voice` | The real recording bar in its screenshot fixture state |
| `bridge-setup` | Timeline benefits and explicit install/defer actions |
| `approval` | A native Claude approval card, without selecting a response |

Full-resolution originals are in [app-screenshots/2026-10-27](app-screenshots/2026-10-27/).
Web assets and launch arguments are in [the asset manifest](../public/assets/app/manifest.json).
Visually inspect every screen before publishing; first-launch initialization
or a concurrent simulator workflow can interrupt a capture.

## Refresh

Use a dedicated simulator so other apps and sessions are not disturbed.
The script requires Python 3 with Pillow and a booted simulator. List devices
with `xcrun simctl list devices available`; use the selected device's actual
UDID in the commands below. Do not use the ambiguous `booted` shorthand.

From the repository root:

```sh
(cd ios && xcodegen generate)
xcodebuild -project ios/Herdcats.xcodeproj -scheme Herdcats \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/herdcats-website-derived CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

xcrun simctl bootstatus <device-udid> -b
python3 web/scripts/capture-app-screenshots.py \
  --device <device-udid> \
  --app /tmp/herdcats-website-derived/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Herdcats.app \
  --raw-dir web/docs/app-screenshots/2026-10-27
```

Use `--only timeline-light` to recapture one screen. The script replaces only
selected asset files and preserves other manifest entries. After inspection,
shut down the dedicated device with `xcrun simctl shutdown <device-udid>`.

## Website validation

Build with `npm ci && npm run build` from `web/`. Serve `web/out/` with any
static file server, then check the landing page and Support on mobile and
desktop in both themes. Verify the screenshot links and these app destinations:

- `/support/#connect`
- `/support/#using-app-codex-shared-background-server`

Support uses an imported stylesheet so its styling survives a direct load of
the production static export. The Features page uses the project's Moonlit colors and typography.
